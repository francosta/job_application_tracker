# Project Overview

This is a Job Application Tracker. It consists of a dashboard where a user can create and track its job applications, along with specific tasks for each application. The app is also connected to the Reed job API which lists current job openings for the user's chosen city and industry.

# Motivation

I have built this app as the final project for my Javascript module of the Flatiron School Software Engineering bootcamp. The brief for the project was a single page application, using vanilla Javascript as the frontend and a Ruby on Rails backend.
Having gone through the process of searching and applying for jobs, I have found that a job application tracker dashboard would be very useful.
